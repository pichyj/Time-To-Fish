      Hmmm...I maybe check out that video at the bottom. I can see what I'm getting myself into.
      <br/><br/>
      Traveling is fun.
      <br/><br/>
      So I decided to close my eyes and point to a place on the map to choose my destination!
      <br/><br/>
      I really enjoy animals, so I might as well catch some fishes. Ooo how exciting!

        I'm a bit thristy. It would be wise to stay hydrated but that would be a waste of time. Should I just
        go to the shop and buy a new fishing rod? That would be cool too. 
        <br/><br/>
        I'm so indecisive.

      Wow the boba was really good. Now time to fish! I wonder what kind of fishing rod I should get.
      
    Choices: 
      - Text: There are probably so many fishing rod choices, I wonder which one I should get.

      I think I will buy the black one. It might attract more fish so I can have a bunch!
      <br/><br/>
      HOLD ON! 2,500 bells!?! I need to save up. Is that even worth it? 
      
    Choices:
      - Text: I should make my own.
        Target: DIY 
      - Text: I will just buy it, it is worth the money.

      To make a fishing rod all I need are five sticks. So easy. This was a better choice than 
      paying 2,500. Now that I have everything, it is time to fish!
    
    Choices:
      - Text: I bet I can catch a shark or some other huge fish!
        Target: Ocean
      - Text: I wonder if the river has some awesome fish to catch!

      Okay let's do this. Woah, that looks like a big fish. Please be a special one.
      <br/><br/>
      Maybe I should go for the smaller fish, it must be easier to carry. 
      
    Choices:
      - Text: Here I go for the big fish! Big money, Big Money!!

      I've seen every episode of River Monsters. I hope to catch a wild monster! Unless I 
      catch something that I already caught. That's fine I guess...but a river monster 
      would be awesome!
      
    Choices: 
      - Text: Fish for the big river monster.

      <br/><br/>
      I have to take a pic and post it on social media. 
      <br/><br/>
      Maybe I should try and do it again and see if the local museum wants to take a look!

      The museum loooks great from the outside and the entrance looks great too. Maybe I should 
      go check out the aquarium and see how it looks like. Maybe they have every single fish that has 
      existed on this Earth!
