      Hmmm...I maybe check out that video at the bottom. I can see what I'm getting myself into.
      <br/><br/>
      Traveling is fun.
      <br/><br/>
      So I decided to close my eyes and point to a place on the map to choose my destination!
      <br/><br/>
      I really enjoy animals, so I might as well catch some fishes. Ooo how exciting!

        I'm a bit thristy. It would be wise to stay hydrated but that would be a waste of time. Should I just
        go to the shop and buy a new fishing rod? That would be cool too. 
        <br/><br/>
        I'm so indecisive.

      Wow the boba was really good. Now time to fish! I wonder what kind of fishing rod I should get.

      I think I will buy the black one. It might attract more fish so I can have a bunch!

      HOLD ON! 2,500 bells!?! I need to save up. Is that even worth it?

      To make a fishing rod all I need are five sticks. So easy. This was a better choice than 
      paying 2,500. Now that I have everything, it is time to fish!

      Okay let's do this. Woah, that looks like a big fish. Please be a special one.
      <br/><br/>
      Maybe I should go for the smaller fish, it must be easier to carry.

      I've seen every episode of River Monsters. I hope to catch a wild monster! Unless I 
      catch something that I already caught. That's fine I guess...but a river monster 
      would be awesome!

      The museum loooks great from the outside and the entrance looks great too. Maybe I should 
      go check out the aquarium and see how it looks like. Maybe they have every single fish that has 
      existed on this Earth!

      I don't have all the time in the world so I'll just talk to this guy at the front.
